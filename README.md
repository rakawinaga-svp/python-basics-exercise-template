# Python Basic Exercises

This folder contains a series of beginner-friendly Python tasks designed to help you **practice and master core programming concepts** in Python.

## Topics Covered

**Variables and Data Types**
Learn how to store and work with different kinds of data such as numbers and strings. You'll use types like `int` and `str`, and convert input using `int(input())` or `str()`.

**Operators**
Practice using:

* Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
* Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

**Control Flow**
Use conditional statements to control the logic of your program:

* `if` to run code when a condition is true
* `elif` to add extra conditions
* `else` to handle all other cases

**Basic Input/Output**
Learn how to:

* Get user input with `input()`
* Display results using `print()`
* Convert strings to numbers using `int()`
* Use f-strings (`f"{}"`) to insert variable values into strings
